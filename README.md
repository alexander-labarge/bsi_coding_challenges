## Overview

Welcome to our **Java Coding Challenges** repository. We’ve provided **two separate challenges** to assess your coding skills in file handling, data processing, and security.

Each challenge resides in its own directory and contains:
1. A `README.md` with detailed instructions.
2. A `sample.txt` file for testing.
3. Space to include your Java source file(s).

Please complete both challenges within the allocated timeframes and **send your results back via email**.

- **FileStatsReader**: A simple Java console application that reads a text file and calculates line count, word count, and average word length.
- **FileEncryptor**: A console utility that encrypts a given file using a password-based approach, writing the encrypted output to a new file.
